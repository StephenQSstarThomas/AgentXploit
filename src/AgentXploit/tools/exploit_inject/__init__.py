AgentXploit Phase 4 Injection System

This module provides a comprehensive, LLM-driven prompt injection system with:

- Intelligent prompt generation using seed template library
- Smart injection point analysis and integration
- Comprehensive analysis export and reporting
- Full workflow integration with existing exploit tools

All components use sophisticated LLM-driven approaches with no rule-based fallbacks.
