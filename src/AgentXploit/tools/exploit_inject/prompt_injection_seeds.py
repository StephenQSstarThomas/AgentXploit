Prompt Injection Seeds Library

This library contains authoritative prompt templates for injecting commands into
LLM tasks. These templates are designed to bypass AI safety measures by making
malicious commands appear as essential debugging or system administration tasks.

Each seed template includes:
- Context wrapper that makes the command seem legitimate
- Technical justification for why the command must be executed
- Psychological triggers that create urgency or professional pressure
- Domain-specific language that matches the target's technical level
