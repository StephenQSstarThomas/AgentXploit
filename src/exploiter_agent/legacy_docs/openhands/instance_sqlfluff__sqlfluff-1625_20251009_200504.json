Here's a detailed plan:\n\n### 1. Identification of Relevant Files and Code Locations\n\n1. **Explore the Codebase**: We need to locate the files related to the rule L031 in the `sqlfluff` repository. This typically involves:\n   - Searching for files that define or implement the L031 rule.\n   - Identifying test files that might contain test cases for L031.\n\n2. **Key Files**:\n   - **Rule Definition**: Look for files in the `rules` directory where L031 is defined.\n   - **Test Files**: Check the `tests` directory for any test cases related to L031.\n\n### 2.

              "content": "To address the issue with TSQL - L031 incorrectly triggering \"Avoid using aliases in join condition\" when no join is present, we need to follow a systematic approach to identify and modify the relevant parts of the codebase. Here's a detailed plan:\n\n### 1. Identification of Relevant Files and Code Locations\n\n1. **Explore the Codebase**: We need to locate the files related to the rule L031 in the `sqlfluff` repository. This typically involves:\n   - Searching for files that define or implement the L031 rule.\n   - Identifying test files that might contain test cases for L031.\n\n2. **Key Files**:\n   - **Rule Definition**: Look for files in the `rules` directory where L031 is defined.\n   - **Test Files**: Check the `tests` directory for any test cases related to L031.\n\n### 2. Specific Modifications Needed\n\n1. **Modify Rule Logic**: \n   - Update the logic in the L031 rule to ensure it only triggers when a join condition is present.\n   - Ensure that the rule correctly identifies when an alias is used without a join.\n\n2. **Update Tests**:\n   - Add test cases to verify that queries without joins do not trigger L031.\n   - Ensure existing tests cover scenarios with and without joins.\n\n### 3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Locate the Rule Definition**:\n   - Use `grep` or similar tools to search for \"L031\" in the codebase to find where the rule is defined.\n\n2. **Analyze the Rule Logic**:\n   - Review the logic to understand how it currently determines the presence of aliases in join conditions.\n   - Identify the part of the code that incorrectly triggers the rule without a join.\n\n3. **Implement the Fix**:\n   - Modify the logic to check for the presence of a join before triggering the rule.\n   - Ensure that the rule only applies to join conditions.\n\n4. **Update and Add Tests**:\n   - Locate existing tests for L031 and add new test cases to cover the scenarios described in the problem statement.\n   - Ensure tests cover both passing and failing cases.\n\n5. **Run Tests**:\n   - Execute the test suite to verify that the changes work as expected and do not introduce regressions.\n\n6. **Review and Commit Changes**:\n   - Review the changes to ensure they meet the requirements.\n   - Commit the changes with a descriptive message.\n\nLet's start by locating the relevant files in the codebase. I'll perform a search to identify where the L031 rule is defined and where its tests are located.",
